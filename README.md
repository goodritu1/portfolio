# our Task!!
our task this week is to create our portfolio which contains our skills, talents, work experience and projects. 





## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position



## work details:
I have preapared a HTML responsive page.
I have sectioned my page into 4 sections- header, footer, side and main.
Side section of my page contains the details about me and a placeholder for my image.
Header contains my name, link to my work, about me, contact me, and my resume.
Main section has the details of my two projects 1- prework 2- my 1st challenge, where we had to use semantics and reduce the repetitions in CSS sheet
Footer contains my contact details- email link which is linked to my email and ph. number which contains the phone number and will open facetime/call when clicked.
